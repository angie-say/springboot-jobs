The old models of teaching and learning are in the midst of the largest transformation in history, and D2L is at the heart of that fundamental shift.</p>\n<p>\nNew models of teaching and learning enable a personalized, student-centric experience – and deliver improved retention, engagement, satisfaction, and results for learners of all ages – in schools, campuses, and companies.</p>\n<p>\nD2L is disrupting the way the world learns, by providing the next generation learning environment and solutions to engage and inspire learners. And most importantly, by giving customers a platform that is easy, flexible, and smart. No other company provides a solution as robust and innovative as D2L.</p>\n<p>\nD2L has had a singular mission for 20 years and is dedicated to that same mission in the years ahead: to transform the way the world learns – and by doing so, we will help improve human potential globally.</p></div><p>\nEvery day, our software is used by millions of people around the world, and we are looking for students who share in our excitement and passion for transforming the way the world learns. At D2L, we believe that learning should be accessible and engaging. Our goal is to create easy, flexible, and smart software that ignites the desire to learn in everyone. To do this, we need to give talented, enthusiastic, and passionate people, like you, opportunities to create, develop, and collaborate on projects that revolutionize the learning environment.</p>\n<p>\nWhether you’re a first year Co-op or looking for a place to transition into as a New Graduate, we are looking for superstars to help influence and provide innovative insights into future versions of our Brightspace software. You’ll thrive in our agile culture, where teams speak freely and collaborate to solve interesting problems, and will be constantly learning and looking for ways to innovate. If you get stuck, you can work with your assigned mentor to figure out the best way to proceed.</p>\n<p><b>\nWhat you’ll get out of working at D2L</b></p>\n<p>\nThe challenges and responsibilities given, ability to learn new things, and work on meaningful product that reaches over 15 million learners daily, are just a few of the things that set D2L apart as a student employer. With an open office concept and overall work environment (not a single employee has their own office, including our CEO), we are located in the historic Lang Tannery in downtown Kitchener.</p>\n<p>\nAt D2L, you will have the opportunity to work with the latest technologies to build highly scalable and fault tolerant systems. On the backend, our product is built on the .NET stack, but we have a growing ecosystem of cloud-native services built on the AWS platform leveraging technologies such as Node.js, SNS, SQS, Kinesis, DynamoDB, Serverless (Lambda), etc. On the front-end we use Polymer and other web frameworks to build engaging and responsive web apps. We also build native mobile apps in Kotlin and Swift. Ultimately, we strive to use the most appropriate technologies to achieve our goal of changing the way the world learns. You don\'t need to know how to use these yet, we\'ll help you learn!</p>\n<p><b>\nWhat is D2L looking for from me?</b></p>\n<p>\nYou have a strong entrepreneurial drive, an enthusiastic and dedicated mindset and a thirst for a challenge. The ability to think on your feet and work successfully both in independent and team-settings is essential. At D2L, our co-ops have a voice and are able to quickly contribute to their team\'s objectives (we don’t have “co-op projects”, you’ll be working on real deliverables).</p>\n<p><b>\nEducation Recommendations\n</b></p><p>Currently a candidate for Bachelor\'s degree or diploma in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field with the Co-op option</p>\n<p><b>\nWhy we\'re awesome</b></p>\n<p>\nEmployees at D2L enjoy perks in our offices such as Ping-Pong tables, Foosball Tables, free snacks, dogs in the office, old school video games (Commodore 64 &amp; Nintendo 64) and board games everywhere (we even host a monthly board games night!).
